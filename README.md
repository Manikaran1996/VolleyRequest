# VolleyRequest

In this project, I have implemented the standard requests in Volley viz. StringRequest, JSONRequest and ImageRequest. For testing purpose, I have created web service in python flask, included in project with name web_service.py.
In web service, I have implemented 3 main functions namely factorial, combination and get_image used for testing StringRequest, JSONRequest and ImageRequest respectively.
